Sample Price Feed App
**********************

This section describes how a price feed app is developed using Muon. It is made up of two sections: 
  1- In the first section, we describe how an app is developed to calculate Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) of a pair of tokens based on the information it gets from a Uniswap pool or one of its forks. 

  2- we explain how to use the app from section one to obtain a tokenâ€™s price from a route made of pairs that ends with a stablecoin as well as calculating a Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of routes in different exchanges on different chains
